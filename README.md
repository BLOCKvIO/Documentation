# Welcome

Our GitHub repository is now up! For the past 2 years we have built out a robust, scaleable platform with a ton of code. In the coming weeks, we will be open-sourcing comprehensive Software Development Kits (SDKs) for different platforms and canâ€™t wait for your contributions! If you scroll down you will find links to our API docs (via Postman) and several other developer documents. 

We hope to foster an active community of developers that are building amazing things by leveraging and contributing to our projects.

# BLOCKv - The foundation of the Virtual Goods Economy

BLOCKv, the shared protocol for the blockchain developer stack, represents the interface moment in the maturation of the blockchain sector. BLOCKv provides developers with the building blocks to design the experiential economy of the future and unlock new revenue generating opportunities for businesses within this growing ecosystem. The BLOCKv platform enables the creation of smart digital objects on blockchains unlocking the potential to rapidly engage end-users and traverse digital and real-world environments. 

These smart objects, called vAtoms (Virtual Atoms) combine code with multimedia elements and are dynamic, compelling digital goods that make a cryptocurrency come alive as an asset for developers, brands and end users.

Digital objects are an increasingly important part of the human experience: from in-game goods, digital cards and art that we collect, to digital books and music, and items we exchange on social networks.
