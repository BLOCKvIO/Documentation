# The BLOCKv API

The API collection for publisher and a wallet app are currently available to participants of our closed beta developer program. The full API will be publicly available with our first release of the BLOCKv platform in Q1/2018.

## BLOCKv Publisher API
The publisher API describes the endpoints provided by the BLOCKv platform for a vAtom developer or publisher to create vAtom Templates and Template Variation as well as to emit unique vAtoms. It also allows a publisher to configure the Actions for a user to interact with the vAtom such as Transfer, Acquire or Redeem, ect and to define the graphical interface (look&feel) of the vAtom be defining the Faces.
